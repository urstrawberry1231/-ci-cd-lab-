1. CI (Continuous Integration) means that developers keep merging their code into a shared repository frequently. Each merge is automatically tested to make sure the new code works well with the existing project.
   CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment) is the process that makes sure the software can be delivered or deployed to users quickly and reliably after passing all the tests.
2. Automation is important because it saves time and reduces human errors. Instead of doing things like testing or deployment manually, automation makes the process faster and more consistent. It also helps developers
   focus more on coding and improving the project instead of repeating the same tasks.
3. CI/CD pipelines improve teamwork because all developers can see if the code is working or not in real-time. It prevents problems from piling up since issues are detected early. It also improves software quality because
   tests run automatically, and only stable code gets delivered, making the final product more reliable for users.
4. One challenge I faced was understanding how the tools work together, the CI/CD platform, and the project repository. At first, I got confused with configuration files and where to put the commands. Another
   challenge was dealing with errors during the pipeline setup because sometimes the error messages were not clear. But as I practiced and researched, I slowly understood the process and gained confidence in setting up the pipeline.
